# Writing reports

## A template

- [Template Report used by AEA](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/REPLICATION.md)
- [A guided tour of the template](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/replicability-training-curriculum/a-guided-walk-through-the-replication-report.html)

## A guide to language

- Remain objective, no value-laden language ("code does not work" is objective, "code is badly constructed" is a value judgement)

- Although you are unlikely to contact the authors, they are likely to read your output. 
- Review [ACRE guide](https://bitss.github.io/ACRE/comunications.html)
